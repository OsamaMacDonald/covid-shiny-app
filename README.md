# covid-shiny-app


This Repository contains the code for my MSc Data Analytics dissertation project. I developed a Shiny web application in R
which could visualise the non-pharmaceutical interventions that countries used to contain the spread of Covid-19. 

The app can be found at https://osamamacdonald.shinyapps.io/covid-shiny-app/. 



# Running the App

Due to the size limit of files, i was unable to upload the major csv file to github for download. The Data Prep r file can be used
to acquire the dataset from it's online source, where it is updated daily, and prepare the data to be used in the app.
